    Learn matrix factorization optimizing the WARP loss

    Parameters
    ==========
    d : int
        Dimensionality of factors.
    gamma : float
        Learning rate.
    C : float
        Regularization constant.
    batch_size : int
        Mini batch size for SGD updates.
    positive_thresh: float
        Consider an item to be "positive" i.e. liked if its rating is at least this.
    max_trials : int
        Number of attempts allowed to find a violating negative example during updates.
        In practice it means that we optimize for ranks 1 to max_trials-1.
